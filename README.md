# What-Is-A-Chemical-Dosing-System-
A chemical dosing system is a complete set of equipment that includes dosing, mixing, liquid transportation, and automatic control. It's also known as a chemical feed system or a dosing machine. <br>

It is used for raw power plants, boiler feed water, dehydration treatment systems for oil field ground gathering and transportation, petrochemical dosing systems, and wastewater treatment systems.<br>

The Operation of a Chemical Dosing Pump<br>

Chemical dosing pumps, also known as metering pumps, are available in various designs and provide years of dependable and effective service. In most chemical dosing applications, dose precision is crucial. A chemical dosing pump works in the same way that a positive displacement pump does. <br>

The most significant component of these pumps is the valve that pulls the chemical liquid from the chemical tank to the pump. Thus, this valve must be sourced from reliable industrial valves manufacturers to ensure optimum pump performance. When the chemical liquid level goes below a specified level, a switch on the pumps sounds an alarm.<br>

Chemical dosing pumps draw a specific volume of fluid into a chamber and then inject that volume into the dosed container. A chemical dosing pump is designed to be reliable as a function; thus, it should take care of itself and not require much input once properly configured. <br>

The best chemical dosing pumps automate fluid flow in various industries, including pharmaceutical water treatment plants. The pump works discontinuously, producing a magnetic field each time a pulse strikes the magnet. The magnetic field pushes the piston. A diaphragm compresses the liquid into the pump head (attached to the piston head).<br>

The liquid escapes through the delivery valves while the suction valves are closed. When the pulse stops, the piston and diaphragm are returned to their original places by a spring. While the delivery valve is closed, the vacuum created by the diaphragm action sucks liquid from the suction valve into the pump head. Pump capacity is related to the number of strokes and internal volume of the pump head. <br>

In the chemical industry, pumping equipment is in high demand. Any interruption in production or spillage of fluid can be costly and hazardous to one's health and safety. Thus, make sure to source your pump from reliable chemical dosing pump manufacturers in India.<br>

Components Of A Chemical Dosing Pump System<br>

A Chemical Dosing Pump comprises several components that all work together to make it function. The components are as follows:<br>

Chemical Storage Tank<br>
The dosage material is kept in the chemical tank.<br>

Chemical Dosing Pump<br>
The best chemical dosing pumps include an input, a chemical dosing line, and a suction line. A pump's size and materials vary based on its application. A chemical dose pump can be made of various materials, including rubber, plastic, and stainless steel.<br>

Injector<br>
An injector is a non-return valve that enables a chemical to be injected into a flow. The injector's purpose is to easily combine a chemical in equal amounts with a liquid or product while overcoming pipe pressure. When the pump is turned off, the injector contains a self-actuated mechanism that stops the liquid in the delivery line from rising. This injector also guides the delivery tof the chemical to the center of the flow, thereby reducing product waste. Chemicals that are inappropriately dosed may cause damage to the walls, mainly if they contain acids or peroxides.<br>

Foot Valve<br>
As the name implies, this is a one-way or non-return valve connected to the suction line. It is typically found close to the product drum. It is attached to a float switch that checks the product's availability. When the product is depleted, this switch sounds an alarm. Using a suitable quality foot valve from reliable <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/services/pumps-and-valves/kaivalves.php">industrial valves manufacturers</a> will ensure that your chemical dosing system performs efficiently. <br>

Control System<br>
Most plant owners now use software and control systems to ensure that the combine and amps operate properly. These control systems can help with pump automation for enhanced performance. Chemical dosing pump manufacturers in India provide sensor-driven central control systems and SCADA systems. Sensor control systems detect pollutants such as chlorine, pH, and others in the environment.<br>

Types Of Applications For Chemical Feed Systems<br>

•	Municipal water: disinfection systems, sodium hypochlorite, pH modification, fluoride addition<br>

•	Food and beverage: in-situ and off-line cleaning, as well as disinfectant water treatment<br>

•	Institutional: cooling tower waste treatment, boiler water treatment, closed-loop systems<br>

•	Municipal wastewater: general odor control, fume scrubbers, pH adjustment, residual disinfectant management<br>

•	Other applications: mining and agriculture, swimming pools and water parks, utilities and dairy industries, pulp and paper, oil and gas activities, and crude oil processing.<br>
